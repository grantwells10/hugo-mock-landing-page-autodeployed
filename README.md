# hugo-mock-landing-page

Hugo landing page for DJ-GPT - An AI-Powered Assistant for DJs, VJs, and Sound Technicians, designed to elevate the club, festival, and casual DJ experience for audiences everywhere.

I created this new imported repository so that I could use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. See .github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yaml to see the code that is used for this. Note that I used peaceiris by Shohei Ueda to assist with this automation, and I also had to relax the privacy settings on GitHub for the repository.
